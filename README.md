## Twitter Datasets Preparation

Download the tweet datasets from here:
https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/CIL/dataset/final_dataset&fileid=1951904263
This link contains a train split, a validation split and a test split (label unknown). The train and validation splits are created by spliting the original training set provided by the ETH CIL course team.
These datasets are preprocessed using the same preprocessing procedure described in the report.



The dataset should have the following files:
- sample_submission.csv
- train_neg.txt :  a subset of negative training samples
- train_pos.txt: a subset of positive training samples
- test_data.txt:
- train_neg_full.txt: the full negative training samples
- train_pos_full.txt: the full positive training samples

- vocab.txt vocab.pkl vocab_cut.txt
- cooc.pkl: cooccurance matrix
